Modified by NISI 11.10.2017 to demonstrate the scope of global variables.
Global variables should be avoided to prevent accidental overwrite.
 
Challenge: Put the var declaration inside main and obtain the same functionality using pointers.
Solution: Modify the functions to accept a pointer as parameter. Pass the address of var to the functions.
